# spam-tx

This repository spams an Ethereum network with transactions. These transactions only contain an ether transfer of 1 ETH
to random addresses. Randomness in terms of the value sent and contract creation transactions could be added in the future.

I am planning to use this repo for a core ETH project I am considering to develop.
